# blocks.mod

This SwiftyEdit addon helps you to use complex Bootstrap components without having to know the exact syntax.

Simply select the desired template (component) and enter your data in the form.

### How to get the contents into your page

You have the choice. Copy the Shortcode and paste it into your page. 
Or copy the generated Code and paste it into your page it's source code.

### When shouldd I use the Shortcode and when the source code

If you use the shortcode you have to enable this addon for global use. You can edit this snippet anytime without 
open your page. Because no real contents are pasted in the page - only the reference to the entry in the addon.

If you pasted the generated source code, you don't need to activate the addon. But when you have changes to your 
snippet, you have to overwrite*change the source code of your page. Your blocks.mod Entry will be there anyway - so 
you can do your changes in the addon and copy/paste the source code as often as you like.
